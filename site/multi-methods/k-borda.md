# k-Borda

Award m−1 points for first place, m−2 for second, down to zero for last. Elect the k candidates with the largest totals.

**Ballot:** ranking. **API identifier:** `k-borda` at `/multi/simulate`.

## Counting rule

1. Assign positional Borda points to every candidate on each complete ballot.
2. Add the weighted points across ballot groups.
3. Elect the k largest candidate totals.

**Implemented variant:** The separable top-k Borda rule; it is different from quota Borda, which seeks representation for coalitions.

**Ties:** The simulation chooses exactly the requested number of candidates. Earlier IDs in candidates have priority when a count needs a tied choice; later IDs are eliminated first. tie reports a consequential tied decision, not extra seats or additional elected candidates. Mathematical properties of an unbroken correspondence may require different tie assumptions. The returned committee always has exactly `seats` members. Here `tie` reports a tie resolved during selection; it does not mean that electing several people is itself a tie. See [committee inputs and ties](/multi-ballots.md).

## Worked example

There are four candidates and two seats. Ranked examples use six A > B > C > D ballots, three C > D > A > B ballots, and one D > C > B > A ballot. Approval, score, and cumulative inputs are supplied explicitly as shown below. Sortition uses no ballots.

```json
{
  "method": "k-borda",
  "seats": 2,
  "candidates": [
    "A",
    "B",
    "C",
    "D"
  ],
  "ballots": [
    {
      "ranking": [
        "A",
        "B",
        "C",
        "D"
      ],
      "count": 6
    },
    {
      "ranking": [
        "C",
        "D",
        "A",
        "B"
      ],
      "count": 3
    },
    {
      "ranking": [
        "D",
        "C",
        "B",
        "A"
      ],
      "count": 1
    }
  ],
  "options": {
    "maxScore": 5,
    "budget": 100,
    "limit": 1,
    "seed": 1
  }
}
```

**The selected committee is A and C.** With three, two, one, and zero points per ranking, the totals are A 21, B 13, C 17, D 9. The two largest totals elect A and C.

The response shows the intermediate calculation. Exact fractions are used internally where the rule needs them; JSON displays their numerical values.

```json
{
  "method": "k-borda",
  "seats": 2,
  "winners": [
    "A",
    "C"
  ],
  "tie": false,
  "trace": [
    {
      "tally": {
        "A": 21,
        "B": 13,
        "C": 17,
        "D": 9
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Run the algorithm

Each block includes its helpers and sample data, with no project imports. Python needs version 3.9 or newer; TypeScript runs directly with Node 22.18 or newer. These programs demonstrate counting valid profiles. The [complete engines and HTTP server](/multi-api.md) validate inputs and enforce the documented computation limits.

## Simulate this committee through HTTP

Start `python3 python/server.py` from the repository root. Save the request above as `committee.json`, then run:

```sh
curl --fail-with-body http://127.0.0.1:8000/multi/simulate \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-binary @committee.json
```

The server executes this Python counting function and returns the response shown above. The [committee API guide](/multi-api.md) explains the response fields and errors. The [single-winner endpoint](/api-design.md) remains available separately.

## Criteria and assumptions

Read the [multi-winner criteria guide](/multi-criteria.md) before comparing labels. A criterion concerns whole classes of elections, not just this worked count. **Conditional** requires the stated domain or tie assumptions. **Unverified** records an unresolved assessment for the exact variant, rather than filling an empty source cell with a guarantee. Several committee criteria depend on how a voter compares groups of candidates; those assumptions are part of the definition.

| Criterion | Assessment | Explanation and source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Proportionality for solid coalitions](/multi-criteria.md#proportionality-solid-coalitions) | fail | Independent candidate totals do not reserve a coalition its proportional number of seats. SNTV can protect one strongly supported first choice while still failing the full coalition guarantee. [Source](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02891). |
| [Solid coalition](/multi-criteria.md#solid-coalition) | fail | A candidate with N/k first choices can lose to candidates receiving enough second/later Borda support or Bloc marks. Largest aggregate totals do not alone establish a coalition quota. [Source](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02891). |
| [Candidate monotonicity](/multi-criteria.md#candidate-monotonicity) | pass | Increasing one elected candidate’s own support cannot worsen its compared score relative to opponents. In the reweighted sequential rule it can move the candidate to an earlier election round; it does not require retaining the same other winners. [Source](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01795). |
| [Group support monotonicity](/multi-criteria.md#support-monotonicity) | not-applicable | The existing-approval-ballot group-support definition used here is not the implemented input domain. Ranked and scored support changes need their own explicit extension. [Source](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01795). |
| [Weak Pareto](/multi-criteria.md#weak-pareto) | pass | Under the ordinal replacement test, unanimous A above B ensures that a winning outcome including B does not exclude A from every possible winning committee. Fixed priority may select just one member of that correspondence. [Source](https://flore.unifi.it/handle/2158/1175914). |
| [Strong Pareto](/multi-criteria.md#strong-pareto) | pass | Under the ordinal replacement test, if everyone ranks A above B, an elected B cannot be retained while A is absent in the standard rule. This is candidate dominance, not an unstated utility comparison between whole committees. [Source](https://flore.unifi.it/handle/2158/1175914). |
| [Consensus committee](/multi-criteria.md#consensus-committee) | fail | Balanced first-choice support need not determine positional totals or weakest pairwise contests. The cited ordinal analyses provide consensus-committee failures. [Source](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02891). |
| [Fishburn Condorcet committee](/multi-criteria.md#fishburn-condorcet) | unverified | Candidate rankings or numerical ballot entries do not by themselves specify how a voter compares entire committees. No Fishburn guarantee is claimed without choosing that extension. [Source](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01795). |
| [Gehrlein Condorcet committee](/multi-criteria.md#gehrlein-condorcet) | unverified | No exact-variant guarantee or counterexample is established here. The cited definition is a starting point; a blank comparison cell is not a result. [Source](https://flore.unifi.it/handle/2158/1175914). |
| [Condorcet winning set](/multi-criteria.md#condorcet-winning-set) | unverified | No exact-variant guarantee or counterexample is established here. The cited definition is a starting point; a blank comparison cell is not a result. [Source](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02891). |
| [Smith requirement for committees](/multi-criteria.md#smith) | unverified | No universal committee Smith relation is fixed for this rule. Applying the single-winner Smith set can be impossible when it has fewer members than the requested committee; a committee-graph definition must be supplied first. [Source](https://aso.icann.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/schulze2.pdf). |
| [Committee monotonicity](/multi-criteria.md#committee-monotonicity) | pass | The underlying candidate ranking is independent of k. Keeping the same candidate priority and other options, taking its first k and first k+1 yields nested committees. [Source](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02891). |
| [Independence of irrelevant alternatives](/multi-criteria.md#iia) | unverified | No exact-variant guarantee or counterexample is established here. The cited definition is a starting point; a blank comparison cell is not a result. [Source](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01795). |
| [Consistency](/multi-criteria.md#consistency) | pass | For a fixed k and fixed ballot rule, each committee’s objective is a sum of candidate totals, which themselves add over electorates. Common maximizing committees remain exactly the common maximizers after addition; fixed priority selects consistently. [Source](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01795). |
| [Participation](/multi-criteria.md#participation) | unverified | A participation conclusion requires a preference over committees and, for random methods, lotteries. The API records candidate preferences rather than imposing that utility extension; no unconditional no-show guarantee is claimed. [Source](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01795). |
| [Clone independence](/multi-criteria.md#clone-independence) | unverified | A multi-seat clone definition and treatment of multiple elected copies are required. Fixed candidate priority can also distinguish exact clones; a single-winner claim is not transferred automatically. [Source](https://aso.icann.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/schulze2.pdf). |
| [Homogeneity](/multi-criteria.md#homogeneity) | pass | Uniform replication either multiplies all compared totals by the same positive factor, preserves harmonic objectives up to that factor, or leaves all conditional sampling shares unchanged. This concerns the selected committee or distribution, not trace numbers. [Source](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02891). |
| [No favorite betrayal](/multi-criteria.md#favorite-betrayal) | unverified | Sincere committee preferences and the permitted strategic ballot domain must be specified. The single-winner favorite-betrayal theorem is not automatically a theorem about k seats. [Source](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01795). |
| [Semi-honest strategy](/multi-criteria.md#semi-honest) | unverified | No best-response guarantee is proved for this exact committee rule, ballot domain, and tie policy. Honest-looking sample ballots do not establish a strategic existence theorem. [Source](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01795). |
| [Universally liked candidates](/multi-criteria.md#universally-liked) | unverified | No exact-variant guarantee or counterexample is established here. The cited definition is a starting point; a blank comparison cell is not a result. [Source](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01795). |
| [Weak unanimity](/multi-criteria.md#weak-unanimity) | pass | A unanimously top-ranked k-set is among the optimizing committees. Rules using only first-place or worst-pairwise totals can still leave other co-winning committees. [Source](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02891). |
| [Strong unanimity](/multi-criteria.md#strong-unanimity) | pass | When all voters put the same k-set above every outsider, Borda/Bloc totals or every external pairwise support strictly favor that set over any committee containing an outsider. [Source](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02891). |
| [Fixed majority](/multi-criteria.md#fixed-majority) | fail | A majority supporting the same top-k set need not give every member a sufficiently high positional, first-choice or worst-contest score. These rules do not provide the fixed-majority committee guarantee. [Source](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02891). |
| [Polynomial counting time](/multi-criteria.md#polynomial-time) | pass | The included procedure uses polynomially many candidate, ballot-group, prefix or seat scans. Rational numerator/denominator bit growth is separate from this arithmetic-operation statement. [Source](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01795). |
| [Summability](/multi-criteria.md#summability) | pass | O(m) candidate totals add across precincts and suffice for this fixed seat count and ballot rule. For Bloc, recomputing a different k requires new top-k totals or richer data. [Source](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01795). |
| [Justified representation (JR)](/multi-criteria.md#jr) | not-applicable | This criterion is defined on unrestricted approval sets. The implemented ballot domain supplies different information or restricts marks; no approval threshold is inferred from scores or rankings. [Source](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01795). |
| [Proportional justified representation (PJR)](/multi-criteria.md#pjr) | not-applicable | This criterion is defined on unrestricted approval sets. The implemented ballot domain supplies different information or restricts marks; no approval threshold is inferred from scores or rankings. [Source](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01795). |
| [Extended justified representation (EJR)](/multi-criteria.md#ejr) | not-applicable | This criterion is defined on unrestricted approval sets. The implemented ballot domain supplies different information or restricts marks; no approval threshold is inferred from scores or rankings. [Source](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01795). |

## Cost and limits

O(bm + m log m).

Shared limits: 32 candidates, 10,000 ballot groups and 1,000,000 represented voters; see the API guide for numeric bounds. See the [enforced API bounds](/multi-api.md#limits). An exact enumeration's small input cap does not change its general computational complexity.
